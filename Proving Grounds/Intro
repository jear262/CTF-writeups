These are a few boxes from Offensive Security's Proving Grounds platform. I found the boxes from Proving Grounds "Practice" to be the most helpful in preperation for the OSCP. Some of these are from the free "Play" version with a few from the paid for "Practice" teir. Some of these writeups have missing screenshots due to corruption when moving and exporting.
