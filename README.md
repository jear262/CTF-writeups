Note that these Boxes were completed from the dates of 2017-2025. Some of these were good practice when I was studying for the OSCP while others exceeded what was required of the OSCP. These write-ups come from a varity of platforms such as HackTheBox, Proving Grounds Play/Practice, and TryHackme. Most of these writeups were taken in Joplin and exported to PDF format. These are more so notes of when I was actively doing these challenges so the quality may vary.
